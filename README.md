# Helix Debian package repository

## Introduction

This repository hosts actions and scripts to build a debian package out of 
[helix](http://helix-editor.com), a post-modern modal text editor.

## Set-up

If you want to use the script, you should set up a [rust development environment]
(http://rustup.rs). You should alos install cargo bundle (the latest "development"
version because the last update isn't working with cargo workspaces).
So use:
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/burtonageo/cargo-bundle
```

## Running 

```bash
./helix-deb.sh
```
